# PythonSerialExtractor
A sample of old code used to extract data from dedicated hardware via serial, and match it to registration information.

Repo is work in progress... I am taking my time to ensure there is no client sensetive information and no user data, as well as making the samples self standing.

## Serial Extraction
Serial extraction relies on custom dedicated hardware, whose firmware is not open source. Nonetheless its functionality can be easily seen from the accompanying Python code here.

## Data processing
TO DO: add fake data that can be run by the demo code.
